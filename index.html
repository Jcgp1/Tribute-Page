            <h2>Brief Biography Summary</h2>
            <p>Alexander Fleming was born on August 6, 1881, in Lochfield, Ayrshire, Scotland. He was the third of
                four children in a farming family. After his father passed away when he was just seven years old,
                Fleming's mother worked hard to support the family. He later attended the local school, where he
                showed a keen interest in science and nature.</p>
            <p>Fleming pursued his education at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London, where he graduated in
                1906. He worked as a house physician before serving in the army during World War I. During the war,
                he was stationed in France, where he observed the effects of antiseptics on wounds, leading him to
                question their effectiveness.</p>
            <p>In 1928, Fleming made his groundbreaking discovery of penicillin, which he stumbled upon when he
                noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had contaminated one of his petri dishes and had
                killed the surrounding bacteria. This accidental discovery marked the beginning of modern
                antibiotics and revolutionized medicine, saving countless lives. His work on penicillin was
                recognized when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945, along with Howard
                Florey and Ernst Boris Chain, who helped develop penicillin for widespread use.</p>
            <p>Fleming continued to work in medical research and made significant contributions to the field of
                immunology. He advocated for the responsible use of antibiotics, warning against overuse and misuse,
                which could lead to antibiotic resistance.</p>
            <p>In his later years, Fleming received numerous honors and accolades, including being knighted by Queen
                Elizabeth II in 1944. He passed away on March 11, 1955, in London, leaving behind a legacy that
                transformed the medical field. Today, he is remembered not only for his scientific contributions but
                also for his commitment to improving public health and his belief in the importance of scientific
                inquiry.</p>
